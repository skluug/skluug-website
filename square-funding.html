    <p><i>Posted on Tumblr September 2021. I find my tone in this a little cloying, but better that than too dry for a topic I do legitimately think deserves more attention.</i><p>    

    <p>i feel like more people should be talking about Quadratic Funding. it seems really promising to me. it needs a less dumb name and a single decent accessible explanation though</p>

    <p>Alright! So right now, news media is really bad. It is very difficult to make a profit telling the news, so by volume the vast majority of what gets produced is what little can be profitable, which is inflammatory clickbait drivel. When we are very lucky, the revenue generated by the drivel is used to subsidize good journalism.</p>

    <p>This situation has the basic character of a free-rider problem. It's not that people don't value actual news; it's that, when important reporting is done, everyone winds up hearing about it whether they purchased a subscription or not. Important reporting isn't excludable; Nixon resigned as president of all Americans, not just those who bought the Washington Post that day.</p>

    <p>To pay for public goods, we usually turn to society's main organ for collective action, the government. But we definitely can't trust the Nixon Broadcasting Channel to report on Nixongate for us. And in general, we don't want there to just be one giant media agency under the thumb of whichever color is in power; we want multiple, competing news orgs, appealing to different sensibilities and filling in each others' gaps, responsive to what the public actually values.</p>

    <p>Quadratic Funding is a mechanism for deciding how much public money to give to projects or organizations while avoiding the free-rider problem. In fact, it is a theoretically optimal way to allocate public money, under certain non-obnoxious assumptions about how people behave. It works like this: people anonymously vote-donate to projects they want to receive funding, and then each project receives a budget equal to the square of the sum of the square roots of each individual vote-donation they got. i.e.:</p>

    <p><big>B = ( √a + √b + ... + √z )²</big></p>

    <p>where B is the budget received by the project and a-z are the amount of the individual donations. The effect of this formula is that a large number of people donating a small amount of money can have much more impact than a small number of people donating a large amount of money. If Nixon and 9 of his rich buddies donate $1,000,000 each to the Nixon Broadcasting Channel, they can raise as much money as 10,000 commoners donating just $1 each to the Against Burglary Consortium.<p>

    <p>Now, just dropping a formula and saying "we solved the free rider problem!" is pretty unsatisfying. You'd probably like to know, like, why this works, why it's theoretically optimal. What's going on, intuitively. Unfortunately, while the math itself is not very complicated (the original paper is very readable) I don't think I can give a good explanation of the precise intuition behind it, at the moment. I can recommend Vitalik Buterin's explanation here (though personally I don't find it super satisfying).</p>


    <p>There are certainly strong reasons to be skeptical of Quadratic Funding as a general mechanism for solving public good problems. You might not like that Nixon and his rich buddies are able to get any public money at all. Or you might worry that about where the subsidy money comes from, or that with so little at stake individually, people will vote-donate quantities that won't reflect their enlightened self interest because they don't have much incentive to gather the information they need.</p>

    <p>But at a more basic level, it seems like society currently has only one mechanism for funding public goods, Representative Democracy, and it's the source of endless inefficiency and corruption and pointless zero-sum fighting, and all kinds of important public projects are forced to rely on private donations exclusively. And there's another system, that actually tries to solve the problem analytically, and it does so with simple math and no one's tried it yet and it could be adapted in a million ways. Seems worth a shot!</p>

    <p>Also I think it should be called Square Funding because that sounds way better.</p>
